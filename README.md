# Freeze The Freeze
This is a device created for patients with Parkinson's Disease. Gait freezing is a common symptom of Parkinson's Disease patients such that 
prevents them from moving, as if they are stuck. This increases their risk of falling and injury. This device is used to prevent 
gait freezing by stimulating the tibialis anterior during the onset of freezing. By using MATLAB and running simulations
on users undergoing gait freezing, I was able to determine the point at which freezing occurs. By knowing the onset, the hardware component
can be triggered and run, stimulating the tibialis anterior to lessen the effect/symptom.
